# lodestar-deposit-test

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

This is a simple example of lodestar library usage.
This demo creates a validator private key, creates a deposit message, and signs it.

This shows the following functionality:
- creating a validator key from mnemonic
- creating a browser-compatible signer, signing a message
- creating a signing root, which relies on loading a chain config
- interacting with ssz types
